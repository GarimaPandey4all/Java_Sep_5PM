Q: Need to initialize the member variable when object is construct.
Ans: We need constructor for this.

- constructor is a special type of function or a method
- constructor is call when you create an object of a class.
- So conctructor will initialize the member variable 
- contructor name is same as class name
- Constructor never return anything
- It is called only once
- One class have multiple constructors, so this thing  is called contructor overloading
- Every class by default have default constructor
- So if you create any other constructor the default one is killed
