Core Java:

- Write Once Run Anywhere
- Platform Independent
- Platform - O/S + Hardware
- Object Oriented Programming Language - OOPS

Source Code (.java) --> Compiler --> Byte Code (Intermediate Code)(.class) --> Java Runtime Environment (Interpreter)

--> Machine Code / Binary(2 - 0 or 1) Code

Byte Code: Byte code is not a source code and not a machine code, it is only intermediate code


JDK: Java Development Kit
JRE: Java Runtime Enviornment

Code:

IDE: Integrated Development Environment

1. Visual Studio Code
2. Eclipse


Creating First Program in Java:

- Every java program start with class
- Class name should start with Capital Letter
- Class name should be same as File Name


Java Code Compilation and Execution:

- Compile: javac filename.java
- Run: java classname/bytecode
