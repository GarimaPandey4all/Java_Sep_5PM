Core Java

Java History:

- Invented by James Gosling in 1991
- Developed by Sun Microsystems
- The old name of java is "Oak"
- In 1995, first released publicly as java 1.0
- Sun Microsystems sold java to oracle corporation in 2009.

Code Explanation:

Main Method:

- main is a entry point of every java program
- without main java will compile the code and convert it into byte code, but it can't execute the code
or interpret the code.

public - scope in java

public: global, which is accessible for all from anywhere

Why main is public?

- JRE uses main
- java command trigger the JRE
- JRE load class in the memory
- JRE is looking for main
- JRE is outside from your directory/folder
- Outside the folder/package things can access

why main is Static?

- Static things are loaded into memory when class is loaded

why main is void?

- main is void in nature
- main is entry point so there is no need to return anything

main arguments - String args[]

- main has command line arguments
- we can pass any number of arguments, that's why it is array ([])
- [] - array - Array is a collection of similar types of data.
- Array: It is used to store multiple values in a single variable.

What is String?

- String is a collection of characters
- String internally is a char[]
- String is a Predefined class in java as it is in capital letter

What is System.out.println();

- println(): print in new lin, println comes from out object
- out: out is an predefined object, which belongs to PrintStream class
- System: System is a predefined class used for input, output and error
e.g: System.in, System.out, System.err

println vs print:

- println: print in new line
- print: here cursor remains at the end of the text

Can we overload main()?

- Yes, we can overload main
- when we execute the class, JVM (Java Virtual Machine) starts exexution 
with public static void main(String args[])
