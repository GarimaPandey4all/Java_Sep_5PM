Class Relationship

- Communicate b/w two classes

1. IS-A Inheritance

BMW is a Car
Lion is an Animal
Saving Account is a Account
Home Loan is a Loan
Vivek is a Human
Mango is a Fruit
Red is a Color

2. HAS-A Inheritance

BMW has a Driver
Customer has a Order
Customer has a Account
Customer has a Dog
Dog has a Collar
Car has a Engine

- Java provide single inheritance in case of classes(parent and child)
- Java also provide multiple inheritance in case of Interfaces.


1. In Development
One class one file

- If your class is public so class name must be same as file name
- So in one file we can have n non public classes.
- If one file(X.java) has 3 classes e.g:

Class X{} class Y{} class Z{}
After Compile it will create 3 byte codes
X.class, Y.class, Z.class

Inheritance- Parent Child Relationship
by using extends keyword
Benefits: Code Reuse

Overriding:

When Parent Feature is outdated so we override the parent feature in a Child class.
Overriding hide the parent feature.
1. Must be inheritance
2. Method Signature must be same
void roi(), same child has same void roi()
