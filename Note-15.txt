- String internally is a char[]
e.g: String name = "Ram";
char name[] = {'R', 'a', 'm'};

- String is a Predefine class in java
- It is also treat like a data type
- String is a final class, so you can't inherit
- String objects are created in 2 ways:

a) String Literal Style
String name = "Ram";
b) String Object Style
String name = new String("Ram");

- String use string pool
- String objects are immutable

Immutable: String doesn't change existing or original objects, it can create
		new memory or object all the time.


StringBuffer: It is mutuable that means it doesn't create new objects or memory.
