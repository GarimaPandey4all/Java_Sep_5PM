2 major types of programming:

- Procedural Programming - Functions - Divide a problem into functions.
- OOPS: (Object Oriented Programming Langauage) - Wrap all the variables and functions/methods into a single unit.

Why OOPS?

In C Programming:

int x, y;

add()
{
}

sub()
{
}

div()
{
}

mul()
{
}

sin()
{
double x;
}

class A{

int x, y;

add()
{
}

sub()
{
}

div()
{
}

mul()
{
}

}

class B
{
sin()
{
double x;
}
}

is Java has global variable?
- No, because in java every program start with class, and class doesn't have global variable.
