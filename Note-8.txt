OOAD: Object Oriented Analysis and Design
- OOAD provides SOLID Principle

Issue: Duplicacy-Solution

SOLID
D - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Copy Paste Alternative Create a function and call it.

Issue: Security of the code (Data Security)

Solution:

- private member variables and public methods

Encapsulation: Wrap all the variables and methods into a single unit.
example: class

Data Hiding - Good Encapsulation

Data Hiding - make member variables private
Good Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Encapsulation

- Data members - By default scope is default

private - with in the class
default - (not keyword just concept) - scope with in the package / folder
protected - with in the package but we can access also outside the package using inheritance
public - access on any package
